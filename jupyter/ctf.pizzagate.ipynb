Here a usefull tutorial I found this day on the internet : [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqHKRGNrQYU). I use the common 10 usernames and passwords. Who knows it may work ;)\n",

    "After that I try sql injection. In fact the way http basic authentication works is that the user enter the username and  password and the server user base64 to encode the username:password and send it to the server.  The server now decode it and validate it.  The idea is to enter special characters to generate an error. In my case i just enter the following : &é\"' and &é\"' for the username and password.  \n",
